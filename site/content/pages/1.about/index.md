title1: 'Our Story'
content1: |
  Faros is a Christian non-profit organization that provides care and humanitarian support to unaccompanied refugee children and youth, as well as refugee families with children in Athens, Greece. In our work, we are committed to professionalism, accountability, and transparency. Faros is supported by individuals, institutional donors, foundations, as well as local and international church communities.
  
  Faros started from a single observation. In 2011, our co-founder, Patricia Kirk, noticed a 14-year old, unaccompanied, Afghan boy sleeping alone in one of Athens’ public parks. “His face had a lifeless expression. He was utterly invisible,” she recalls. Patricia had already spent months researching child protection in Southern Europe and was deeply moved, realizing that there was a lack of outreach and protection services for unaccompanied children. She decided to act together with co-founder Dan Biswas and through our local partner, the Presbytarian Church of Exarchia, and with support from International Aid Services and Danish church communities Faros was established in 2014.
  
  Faros’ name translates to ‘lighthouse’ in Greek: a sign that one is nearing a safe haven. “The dream was to start a place where refugee children could find a caring environment and professional help, discover their worth, and find hope for the future”, Patricia says.
title2: Vision
content2: 'Our vision is to protect refugee children and youth, help them realize their full potential, and guide them in the direction of a better future. Compassion, respect, encouragement, friendship, and integrity are core values that unite us and shape our approach to helping refugee children.'
title3: Approach
content3: 'We help unaccompanied children and refugee youth find safety, discover their worth, and build a future perspective. We work holistically and take responsibility for each refugee child and youth and provide individual tailored care. Through this we wish to see every unaccompanied child and refugee youth live with dignity and hope and to be equipped to make a positive change in society.'

      title: 'The story of Mahmadullah'
      description: 'This is the story of Mahmadullah, 19, who graduated from Faros'' shelter for unaccompanied refugee children in 2019. As a young adult, he talked to Faros about his experiences and observations. He knows unaccompanied children who turn to petty crimes and prostitution at the center of Athens to get by. Most of his friends have done it. He hasn’t. He knows they are doing it to buy food and clothes, things normally parents would buy for their children. "The poorer you are, the more vulnerable you are," he says. "If it hadn’t been for Faros, I would be a drug addict on the streets right now," he adds.'

      title: 'If I were your mom....'
      description: |
        Staying at home is a privilege. In Greece, thousands of unaccompanied children still live in difficult conditions. The COVID-19 crisis is a reminder that this forgotten population is very vulnerable. 
        
        Faros' "moms" send a message to all these children we are unable to protect at this moment, those living alone in camps and on the streets. We call on the Greek government, the European Union, and NGOs across Europe to urgently cooperate for the development of a comprehensive strategy to protect each unaccompanied refugee child and provide the care needed by these children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        There are more than 111,000 unaccompanied refugee children worldwide — about 4,000 of these are in Greece. Most of these children have no one to look after them and need our help.

      title: 'BBC News visit to Faros'
      description: |
        BBC visited Faros in May 2017 as part of a news story on the global increase of unaccompanied children fleeing violence, conflict, disaster and poverty. According to UNICEF, at least 300,000 unaccompanied and separated children were recorded in some 80 countries in 2015-16, which is a five-fold increase since 2010.
        
        The first part of the feature is from the Faros shelter.
